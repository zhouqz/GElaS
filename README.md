# GElaS


We extend the concept of expression dynamics by tying in an additional analytic factor, restorability, which represents the extent to which genes can bounce back to their <i>ad libitum</i> expression after an <i>Ad Libitum</i>-Fast-Refeed cycle. As such, we developed a Gene Elasticity Score (GElaS) by integrating expression dynamics, restorability, and statistical significance into a single metric that can be used to quantify metabolic elasticity at transcriptome levels! Here, we provide the code and data to calculate the GElaS during an _Ad Libitum_-Fast-Refeed cycle in mice and monkey, separately.
